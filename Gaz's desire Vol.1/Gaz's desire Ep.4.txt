Indy is a great guy
Some one you'd depend on, right?
Doesn't shitpost, doesn't lie
His is name thanos, want to know why?
Well you see it is his hero
The closest thing to love hell ever get, oh?
You see in thanos he has found his calling
Truly grim, disgusting, appalling
But what is it that made him weak
Was it love, lust, his strength at peak?
Nay you see that he's a master
Starting slow and going faster
After trying, failing and growing, he got the gist
Of the penetrating manly fist
Inside his anus he kept on screaming
Please thanos don't stop I'm reaming
Deeper deeper more and more
Like his mother he became a whore
