Ian couldn't help it, he was cornish after all, it was in his blood, deeply engrained into his dna.
He had to do it, he had to became that in which his ancestors had failed.
He wrapped himself in 400 pounds of puff pastry, perfectly crafted to imitate that of which he was in love with.
You see a cornish pasty is a master work of cookery, so perfect, the curves so wonderfully put together, and the meat, dear God did he love the meat inside.
He wrapped himself snug inside the pastry, being the meat he so desired
But any good pastry chef knows you need the egg, or butter, or milk, or some sort of layer on top to make the golden brown, the glorious golden brown that adds to the experience
No egg could fill that hole, no milk could ever satisfy the need for the perfect golden hue
In a rush of pure extacy he knew what he had to do
He remembered that time in university, the time he dare not speak about
He called his old drinking buddies and told them the plan, they were reluctant at first, but with the promise of whiskey they agreed
As he wrapped himself back into the pastry, his face only visible, he looked at them with sheer determination and whispered before sinking entirely into the home he now resides in
"let the bukake begin"
