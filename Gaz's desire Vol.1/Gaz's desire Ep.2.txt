IX looked lovingly into his eyes, he adored this man, he'd do anything for this man.
But all good love stories have a beginning, allow me to regale you with the story.
It was a beautiful day, the birds were singing, the sun was shining, it was as if iX lived in a movie, it couldn't have been more perfect.
But it turns out, it could only have gotten better.
On his way to these cheese factory to endulge in his hobby, he ran into some one who could change his life for ever.
They become friends but quickly flourished into friends with smeggifits. And he couldn't have been happier.
Lovingly embraced in each others arms, he spoke, a soft voice, but a voice that commands respect, his hushed tone made him weak, but a voice he cannot say no too.
He spoke again, and he became weak, as the words came from his mouth, so he too came.
"pecko my weko"
